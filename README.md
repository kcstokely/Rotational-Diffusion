# Rotational-Diffusion
This is a suite of software to create trajectories of a point diffusing on a unit sphere, and use these to calculate a (camera-noisy) linear dichroism signal.

rotation_.c  has the first part -- see source for run options / parameter setting

dichroism_.c has the second part -- it can take the output of the first as input
